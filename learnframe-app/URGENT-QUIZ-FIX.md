# ðŸš¨ URGENT QUIZ FIX NEEDED

## Problem
Users are getting "Quiz not active" errors because **NO QUIZZES EXIST ON BASE BLOCKCHAIN**.

## Root Cause  
Contract owner `0x27650088aD441cE2a10256381246F952F80d51b3` has not deployed quiz questions to the blockchain.

## IMMEDIATE SOLUTION (Choose One)

### Option 1: Command Line (Fastest)
```bash
# 1. Get your contract owner private key
# 2. Run this command:
DEPLOYER_PRIVATE_KEY=0x[YOUR_PRIVATE_KEY] node URGENT-DEPLOY-QUIZZES.js
```

### Option 2: Web Interface  
1. Go to https://learnframe.vercel.app/admin
2. Connect MetaMask with owner wallet `0x27650088aD441cE2a10256381246F952F80d51b3`
3. Switch to Base network (Chain ID: 8453)
4. Click "ðŸš€ Emergency Deploy Quizzes"

## What Will Happen
- 10 quiz questions will be deployed to Base blockchain
- Each quiz costs ~$0.001 in gas fees
- Total cost: ~$0.01
